# CalculatorApp
This is my first more serious project so bare with me. It is a calculator app that takes imput from a file ("evaluare.in") and computes the result in Terminal.

# The Rules are as follows:
  1) The "evaluare.in" file CANNOT contain any spaces. If there is any space character either between digits or between digits and operators, the result will be wrong
  2) The float numbers must be written using ",", not ".". For example, it's: "2,55" , NOT "2.55".
  3) The operators allowed are:
       a) "-" for subtraction
       b) "+" for addition
       c) "*" for multiplication
       d) "/" for division
       e) "^" for power
       f) as many "(" (open parantesis) and ")" (closed parantesis) as the user wants
  4) Parantesis within parantesis ARE allowed
